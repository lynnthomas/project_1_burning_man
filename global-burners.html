                   <p>Burning Man has had such a profound effect on everyone who has attended, that the attendees take away
                      a "seed" of it and "sprinkle" some of that magic back in their native lands. There are countless
                      amounts of decompression events globally that are linked to burning man that help fund raise to make 
                      the main event in the Nevada desert each year happen. But some areas around the world have visioned 
                      bigger, and have designed and producted major events that follow the Burning Man way. These two
                      are the biggest "regional" events globally that Burning Man has to offer.</p>

                   <h2> AFRIKABURN - Tankwa Karoo, South Africa </h2>
                   <p>AfrikaBurn is the spectacular result of the creative expression of participants who gather once a year
                      in the Tankwa Karoo, South Africa to create a temporary city of art, theme camps, costumes, music and 
                      performance. It is an experiment in inclusive community building, decommodification, creativity,
                      self-reliance and radical self-expression. It happens for 7days at the end of April/start of May.

                    <h2> BURNING SEED - NSW, Australia </h2>
                   <p>People new to Burning Seed often assume that a Burn is like a festival - a mostly passive experience
                     where event producers organise everything and you just need to rock up for the show.
                     Instead, a Burn is created by its participants, not for them. There ain't no fancy-pants production 
                     company curating from up on high or digging our ditches down below. There are no sugar-daddy sponsors, 
                     advertisers or stalls either. There is only you + me and a gifting economy.
                     Together, we pool our resources, skills, ideas and imagination to create the funding, the city, the 
                     entertainment and the experience itself. It's a week filled with art, Theme Camps, gifting, performances,
                     crewing, music, fire and more. We also take care of our day-to-day needs and the environment,
                     while we're there and when we leave.
                     It is this very act of collaboration and participation that makes Burning Seed special, and our week 
                     culminates with the burning of the Effigy and the Temple before the city returns once more to forest.</p>
